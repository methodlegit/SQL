#This SQL I am querying a database with various sales tables to quantify data about monthly sales and customer information.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product= 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum 
FROM customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, Min(price) 
FROM JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT *, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT FebSales.Product, FebSales.price, FebSales.Quantity, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count (distinct(customers.acctnum)), avg(Quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id 
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length (orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
